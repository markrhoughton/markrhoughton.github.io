**iOS & Flutter Developer**

I like helping people solve problems. I'm currently working as an iOS and Flutter developer at [Pocketworks](https://pocketworks.co.uk/about/pocketeers/mark-houghton/). 

**Mobile Engineer**

I have experience with both native and cross-platform (Flutter) app development for iOS and Android, but I specialise in developing for the iOS platform.

More recently, I've been working with tools such as Amplitude and Firebase to leverage data-driven approach to feature development, combining Analytics, Remote Config, Audiences and A/B testing to understand which features are most valuable to users. Prior to starting my consultancy career, I worked for a number of years with software in a research setting.

**PhD**

My journey as researcher began during my integrated Masters in Mathematics, at the University of Leeds. During my studies, I picked electives from the School of Computing, such as Parallel Scientific Computing, Combinatorial Optimisation, and Graph Theory. 

Inspired by these electives, I moved from Mathematics and began my PhD in Computational Engineering. My research spanned multiple disciplines, but focused on the numerical simulation of elastic fibre networks, such as those seen in non-woven fabrics, and the cytoskeletons of cells.
