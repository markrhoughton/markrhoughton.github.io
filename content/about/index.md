# SoonCall 
[SoonCall](https://sooncall.com) is a mobile app helping those with established friendships that are at risk of losing touch or disconnectedness. It was motivated by my own difficulties of maintaining long distance friendships after finishing my PhD.
During my time in research I made friends from lots of different backgrounds.
After finishing my research Iâ€™d formed several meaningful friendships, 
But most of these friends moved all over the world, across multiple timezones, making it very difficult to organize a meet up.
The only way I could keep in touch in a meaningful way, was through phone calls.

## How to keep a long distance friendship strong
SoonCall puts voice first, focusing on real connection through meaningful conversations, rather than tone deaf instant messages and asynchronous communication. Using:
- Smart suggestions
- Simple catch up tracking
- Seamlessly organized contacts

And much more, SoonCall aims to fight loneliness risk in the future, by helping you strengthen your closest relationships today, regardless of geographical distance. Check out [sooncall.com](https://sooncall.com) for more info, and to get early access to the iOS app.


# My Background

## iOS & Flutter Developer

I like helping people solve problems. I'm currently working as an iOS and Flutter developer at [Pocketworks](https://pocketworks.co.uk/about/pocketeers/mark-houghton/). 

## Mobile Engineer

I have experience with both native and cross-platform (Flutter) app development for iOS and Android, but I specialise in developing for the iOS platform.

More recently, I've been working with tools such as Amplitude and Firebase to leverage data-driven approach to feature development, combining Analytics, Remote Config, Audiences and A/B testing to understand which features are most valuable to users. Prior to starting my consultancy career, I worked for a number of years with software in a research setting.

## Academia

My journey as researcher began during my integrated Masters in Mathematics, at the University of Leeds. During my studies, I picked electives from the School of Computing, such as Parallel Scientific Computing, Combinatorial Optimisation, and Graph Theory. 

Inspired by these electives, I moved from Mathematics and began my PhD in Computational Engineering. My research spanned multiple disciplines, but focused on the numerical simulation of elastic fibre networks, such as those seen in non-woven fabrics, and the cytoskeletons of cells.
