### Welcome
Hi there, and welcome to my website. 
I'm a consultant and mobile engineer, currently based in Leeds, UK.
I'll be mainly using this space to collect thoughts and things and notes on all things *mobile*, as well as other areas that interest me.
Feel free to look around, or go to the about me page to learn a bit more about what makes me tick.

Any questions, please reach out!
If you want to connect, you can find me at any of the social links I've posted, though LinkedIn is probably where I'll be most responsive.
