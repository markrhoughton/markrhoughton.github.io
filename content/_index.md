# An app for long distance friendships

Hi welcome to my website! 
I'm an app developer at [Pocketworks](https://pocketworks.co.uk) and founder of [SoonCall](https://sooncall.com). 

[SoonCall](https://sooncall.com) is a mobile app in the wellbeing space that focuses on loneliness prevention for those with friends in different cities.
I'll be mainly using this space to collect notes, thoughts and things that are currently capturing my interest.
Feel free to look around, or go to the about me page to learn a bit more about what makes me tick.

Any questions, please reach out!
If you want to connect, you can find me at any of the social links I've posted, though LinkedIn is probably where I'll be most responsive.
