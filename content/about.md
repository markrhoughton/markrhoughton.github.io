**Consultant**

I like helping people solve problems. I'm currently working as a consultant based in the UK, with a focus on mobile engineering. 

**Mobile Engineer**

I have experience with native app development for both Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift). My work has exposed me to both traditional approaches to UI development (xml layouts in Android, UIKit for iOS), and modern reactive approaches (Jetpack Compose, SwiftUI).

More recently, I've been working with tools such as Firebase to leverage data-driven approach to feature development, combining Analytics, Remote Config, Audiences and A/B testing to understand which features are most valuable to users. Prior to starting my consultancy career, I worked for a number of years with software in a research setting.

**PhD**

My journey as researcher began during my integrated Masters in Mathematics, at the University of Leeds. During my studies, I picked electives from the School of Computing, such as Parallel Scientific Computing, Combinatorial Optimisation, and Graph Theory. 

Inspired by these electives, I moved from Mathematics and began my PhD in Computational Engineering. My research spanned multiple disciplines, but focused on the numerical simulation of elastic fibre networks, such as those seen in non-woven fabrics, and the cytoskeletons of cells.
