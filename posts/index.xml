For example, consider the following code
void someMethodWithDate() { final today = DateTime.now(); // code that uses today } If we need to test this function for a fixed time, then we would have to inject DateTime.now() into the method as an argument. This gets quite messy, either making it nullable and only using it for testing, which feels like a hack</description></item><item><title>Closures</title><link>http://example.org/posts/closures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 17:53:03 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/posts/closures/</guid><description>When writing functions that expect functions as arguments
func calculator(numberA: Int, numberB: Int, operation: (Int, Int) -&amp;gt; Int) -&amp;gt; Int { return operation(numberA, numberB) } rather than writing the expected argument as an explicit named function
func addOperation(nA: Int, nB: Int) -&amp;gt; Int { return nA + nB } and calling it like
calculator(numberA: 8, numberB: 3, operation: addOperation) we can pass it as a closure instead
calculator(numberA: 8, numberB: 3, operation: { (nA: Int, nB: Int) -&amp;gt; Int in return nA + nB }) which can be simplified in a number of ways.</description></item><item><title>Getting Up and Running</title><link>http://example.org/posts/getting-started/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 17:34:56 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/posts/getting-started/</guid><description>This site was made using Hugo, which has lowered the barrier to entry for me running my own blog.
Every time I want to create a new post, I can just run
hugo new some-new-post.md from the root directory of this repo.
For a local server instance I run
hugo server -D where the -D flag sets drafts to true, meaning I can view any posts that are still marked as drafts.</description></item></channel></rss>
